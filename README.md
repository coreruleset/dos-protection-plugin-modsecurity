# OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set - DoS Protection Plugin (ModSecurity v2)

## Compatibility

**Important:** This plugin is currently *only* compatible with ModSecurity v2.

Specifically, this plugin is **not** compatible with ModSecurity v3 ("libmodsecurity") because that engine does not implement the `expirevar` action, which this plugin relies on.

## Plugin Expectations: Suitability and Scale

ModSecurity and CRS are suited to protect against small-scale, application level denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks at the network level, distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, and larger DoS attacks are hard to fight with ModSecurity. The reason for this is that the means of ModSecurity degrade under load and hence its ability to effectively handle DoS attacks degrades as well.

In such a situation, CRS proposes the use of one or several of the following options:

- `mod_reqtimeout` on Apache to deal with request delaying attacks like [Slowloris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security))
- `mod_evasive` on Apache since it's been around for more than 20 years
- `mod_qos` on Apache which provides granular control over clients hammering the server
- Using a load balancer / traffic washer with DoS capabilities
- A DoS protection service and/or content delivery network

## Description of Mechanics

When a request hits a non-static resource (`TX:STATIC_EXTENSIONS`), then a counter for the IP address is increased (`IP:DOS_COUNTER`). If the counter (`IP:DOS_COUNTER`) hits a limit (`TX:DOS_COUNTER_THRESHOLD`) within a certain window (`TX:DOS_COUNTER_TIME_SLICE`), then a burst is identified (`IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER`) and the counter (`IP:DOS_COUNTER`) is reset. The burst counter expires after a defined amount of time (`TX:DOS_BURST_TIME_SLICE`).

If the burst counter (`IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER`) is greater equal 2, then the blocking variable is set (`IP:DOS_BLOCK`). The blocking variable (`IP:DOS_BLOCK`) expires within a timeout period (`TX:DOS_BLOCK_TIMEOUT`). All this counting happens in phase 5.

There is a stricter sibling to this rule (9514170) in paranoia level 2, where the burst counter check (`IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER`) hits at greater equal 1.

### Blocking

The blocking is done in phase 1: When the blocking variable is set (`IP:DOS_BLOCK`), then the request is dropped without sending a response. If this happens, a counter is incremented (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`).

When an IP address is blocked for the first time, the blocking is reported in a message and a flag (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG`) is set. This flag expires after the number of seconds configured with `TX:DOS_REPORTING_TIMEOUT`.

When an IP address is blocked and the flag (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG`) is set, the blocking is not reported (to prevent a flood of alerts). When the flag (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG`) has expired (after `TX:DOS_REPORTING_TIMEOUT` seconds) and a new request is blocked, the counter (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`) is reset to 0 and the block is treated as the first block (-> alert).

In order to be able to display the counter (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`) and resetting it at the same time, we copy the counter (`IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`) into a different variable (`TX:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`), which is then displayed in turn.

### Variables

| Variable                   | Description                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `IP:DOS_BLOCK`             | Flag if an IP address should be blocked                                              |
| `IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`     | Counter of blocked requests                                                          |
| `IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG`        | Flag keeping track of alert. Flag expires after 60 seconds.                          |
| `IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER`     | Burst counter                                                                        |
| `IP:DOS_COUNTER`           | Request counter (static resources are ignored)                                       |
| `TX:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER`     | Copy of `IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER` (needed for display reasons)                          |
| `TX:DOS_BLOCK_TIMEOUT`     | Period in seconds a blocked IP will be blocked                                       |
| `TX:DOS_COUNTER_THRESHOLD` | Limit of requests, where a burst is identified                                       |
| `TX:DOS_COUNTER_TIME_SLICE`| Period in seconds of window for which to count requests against the current burst    |
| `TX:DOS_BURST_TIME_SLICE`  | Period in seconds when we will forget a burst                                        |
| `TX:STATIC_EXTENSIONS`     | Paths which can be ignored with regards to DoS                                       |

As a precondition for these rules, please set the following five variables in `dos-protection-config.conf`:

- `TX:DOS_BLOCK_TIMEOUT`
- `TX:DOS_COUNTER_THRESHOLD`
- `TX:DOS_COUNTER_TIME_SLICE`
- `TX:DOS_BURST_TIME_SLICE`
- `TX:DOS_REPORTING_TIMEOUT`

And make sure that `TX:STATIC_EXTENSIONS` is set as required, also in `dos-protection-config.conf`.

## Testing

Hit the service quickly enough (within the set time slice) and frequently enough (exceeding the set threshold) and observe that connections are then dropped.

Be sure that the test connections are _not_ hitting an exempt static extension, as this will not trigger a block and will not be a valid test.
