# Plugin name: dos-protection
# Plugin description: Anti-automation rules to detect denial of service attacks
# Rule ID block base: 9,514,000 - 9,514,999

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the dos-protection-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# tx.dos-protection-plugin_enabled=0.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
#SecRule &TX:dos-protection-plugin_enabled "@eq 0" \
#  "id:9514010,\
#   phase:1,\
#   pass,\
#   nolog,\
#   setvar:'tx.dos-protection-plugin_enabled=0'"

# -- [[ Anti-Automation / DoS Protection ]] ------------------------------------
#
# DoS protection against clients making requests too quickly.
#
# When a client is making more than 100 requests (excluding static files) within
# 60 seconds, this is considered a 'burst'. After two bursts, the client is
# blocked for 600 seconds.
#
# Requests to static files are not counted towards DoS; they are listed in the
# 'tx.static_extensions' setting, which you can change in this file.

# File extensions considered static files.
# Extensions include the dot, lowercase, enclosed by /slashes/ as delimiters.
